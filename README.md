This repo's reference is from [WereHamster's github repo](https://github.com/wereHamster/github-travis-chrome-extension), which is no longer working since github's layout changed.

So I changed the code to fit the new layout. For now, you can see many __travis-ci__ pipelines status in your github repos. As follows:

Click the build icon, you will go to travis page.

## How to install it
For now, if you want to install it. First clone or fork this repo. Then, on your Chrome Extensions page, make sure "Developer mode" is checked. You can then click the "Load unpacked extension..." button and browse to the chrome directory of this repo.

## 中文指南
该chrome插件为在github上的repo提供travis-ci运行状态的提示（见上图1、2），目前的安装方案见上方英文（图3）。困了，后期期望扩展该插件。
